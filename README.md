# Buffalo Museum - Self Guided Tour (Deployment Instructions)
This document teaches how to install the self guided tour application on a server. 

## Dependencies
- Apache server installed
- PHP and MySQL installed

The available instructions are as follows:

### Clone the repository from GitHub
`git clone git@github.com:Parushgit/Buffalo-Museum.git`

### Source URL
`webmaster/login.html`. As visible from the URL, the `login.html` can be found by `cd` into `webmaster/`.

For example if the host name is `www.i-am-the-host.com` and the whole respository is kept in the root directory, URL would look like `www.i-am-the-host.com/webmaster/login.html`.

### APIs
All apis are stored in folder `api`. 
All configurations are stored in folder `config`.
All objects are stored in folder `objects`.
All the above things are required to make apis working fully.

### Database
Below are the scripts to be executed (TBD)

Happy touring :)
